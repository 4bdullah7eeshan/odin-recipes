    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dakota Kelly found this pancake recipe in her Grandma's recipe book.</p>
    <p>Judging from the weathered look of the recipe card, she says it was a <i>family favorite</i>.</p>
    <p>This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
